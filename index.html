            caught in an expansionist logic of <element onclick="myFunction()">never-ending
            collection.</element> The practices of data extraction
            are extending even deeper into areas of human
            life that were once off-limits or too expensive
            to reach.</p>

                Who is texted, which locations are visited, what is read, when devices
